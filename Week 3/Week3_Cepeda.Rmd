## Instructions

The data set below is based on the presidential election during 2016, where it outlined the name of the candidate, the source of the poll (ABC vs, CBS). Discuss your result in your blog. Important note, I made up this data, so this data does not reflect what really happened in the election.

Name <- c("Jeb", “Donald”, "Ted”, “Marco” “Carly”, “Hillary”, “Bernie”)

ABC political poll results <- c(4, 62 51, 21, 2, 14, 15)

CBS political poll results <- c(12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19) 

## data.frame

In the following chunk, I will proceed to store the given variables and apply the "data.frame" function and properly convert into a data frame:

```{r data.frame, echo=FALSE}
# storing data as a data frame
poll_results <- data.frame(
Candidate = c("Jeb", "Donald", "Ted", "Marco", "Carly", "Hillary", "Bernie"),
ABC = c(4, 62, 51, 21, 2, 14, 15),
CBS = c(12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19)
)
print(poll_results)
```
