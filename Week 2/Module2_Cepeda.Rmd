```

## Instructions

a. Evaluate the following function call **myMean**. The data for this function is called **assignment**:

```{r}
# storing vector as 'assignment'
assignment <- c(16,18,14,22,27,17,19,17,17,22,20,22)

# storing 'myMean' function to calculate the mean of vector
myMean <- function(assignment){
  return(sum(assignment)/length(assignment))
}
# displaying assignment mean
myMean(assignment)
```

b. **myMean** result explanation:

```{r}
# verifying results
(myMean2 <- sum(assignment)/12)
```
