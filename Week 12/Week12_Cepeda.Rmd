## The Data:
I will be using the **Big 5** soccer leagues in europe as the data used in this package.
This is because of how prevalent these leagues are for soccer analytics, thus it is the only data I would store. This will allow me to save plenty of time by simply loading the `soccermatrix` package and reading in the desired dataset.

```{r "The Data"}
big5_data <- read_excel("FBref_2122.xlsx")
head(big5_data)
```
NOTE: This data set is not yet cleaned. I need to first try some matrix calculations that would best suit the package. Once I have done that, many variables will be examined to determine the ideal formatting the package user should use.
