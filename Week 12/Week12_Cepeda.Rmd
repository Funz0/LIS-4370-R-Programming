## The Data:
I will be using the **Big 5** soccer leagues in europe as the data used in this package.
This is because of how prevalent these leagues are for soccer analytics, thus it is the only data I would store. This will allow me to save plenty of time by simply loading the `soccermatrix` package and reading in the desired dataset.

```{r "The Data"}
myurl <- "https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats#big5_table"
big5_data <- read.csv(myurl)
```
