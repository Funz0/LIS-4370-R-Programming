Title: Functions to Gather Soccer Data and Convert to Numeric Matrix
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alejandro Cepeda 
Maintainer: Alejandro Cepeda <acepeda19@usf.edu>
Description: The data (sourced from <https://fbref.com/en/>) of both players and
             teams from all major leagues and divisions is available for 
             gathering. Additionally, a function for matrix conversion is 
             available to use for visualizations such as heat maps and even 
             certain machine learning methods that require matrix form data, 
             such as Clustering. The purpose of this package is to skip certain 
             steps that are common when working with statistical soccer data and 
             save some of the user's time with the resourcing from the mentioned
             sources.
